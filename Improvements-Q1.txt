Commenting on ways to improve the implementation:

Optimized Heap Initialization: Currently, we initialize the heap with the first element from each array. However, if we know that the arrays are already sorted, we could find the minimum elements from each array in linear time and initialize the heap with them, improving the initialization time from O(K * log(K)) to O(K).
Parallel Processing: If we're dealing with a large number of arrays or very large arrays, we could explore parallel processing techniques to speed up the merging process.
Memory Efficiency: If memory usage is a concern, we could implement a lazy merging approach where we only merge elements from the arrays as needed rather than merging them all upfront. This could be beneficial when dealing with very large arrays or limited memory resources.
